There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  <!-- > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand. -->
  Quest Log

## Sub-Heading ##
  <!-- > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title. -->
  A personal tome to guide your life quest and record the journey.

## Summary ##
  <!-- > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. -->
  This app gives you the greatest power known to RPG kind: the quest log. Like every modern RPG, now you will have a quick reference to know exactly where you need to focus your efforts next, and complete your real life quest lines. The app will also create a digest, as you complete quests, and record your thoughts, to tell the story of your life.

## Problem ##
  <!-- > Describe the problem your product solves. -->
  In games, we know exactly what to do next. We need only pull up the Quest log. Life tends to be much more ambiguous, and while there are plenty of personal management solutions out there, they often have too little, or too much information, lack clear guidance, and frankly just aren't fun to use. In the vein of gamified productivity, we seek to solve all of that, and go the extra step to give you the story back so that you can look on your successes and recount your journey.

## Solution ##
  <!-- > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. -->
  The app is like looking in the menu of an RPG, but instead of your player character, you are the hero. Ultimately, there will be organized guides, for clarifying goals and personal development lessons, to help make crystal clear what your hero's journey is meant to be. Practically speaking, there are two fundamental focuses for daily use: the next ONE to-do (current quest target), and your habits (the grind). Each will be positively reinforced by your own character level display. Parlaying the satisfaction of leveling up, into real-world impact. Not to mention: you'll be getting more done.

## Quote from You ##
  <!-- > A quote from a spokesperson in your company. -->
  "Be the hero your life is calling you to be."

## How to Get Started ##
  <!-- > Describe how easy it is to get started. -->
  Setup can be done in a matter of minutes. The app will walk you through a brain-dump session (quick or complete) to get all of your thoughts out of your head and in front of your face. Then help you prioritize tasks, so that you will always be seeing exactly (and only) what you need to focus on next.
  <!-- Then, by prioritizing your current major goal (what we call quest lines), guide you through ordering tasks by appropriate priority. Then when you look at your quest log you will see exactly the one thing you need to focus on completing next (current quest target).  -->

## Customer Quote ##
  <!-- > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit. -->
  "I got more done last month, than I did all of last year. And I geek out a little every time I level up!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  <!-- > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next. -->
To give it a try and setup your first quest line go to pretend.url and sign-up for free! Many more features to come as the app is in early development, and your suggestions are most welcome.
